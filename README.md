THE PROJECT SUMMARY:
I will play the role of Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. my role is to transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

This project is designed to follow the key stages of the business intelligence workflow (data prep, data modeling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization & dashboard design) and simulate real-world tasks 

STAGE 1: Connecting & Shaping Data
In this stage we’ll focus on building automated workflows to extract, clean, transform, and load our project data using Power Query, and explore common data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, table transformations, and more:

Data connectors
Storage & import modes
Query editing tools
Table transformations
Connecting to a database
Extracting data from the web
QA & Profiling tools
Text, numerical, date & time tools
Rolling calendars
Index & conditional columns
Grouping & aggregating
Pivoting & unpivoting
Merging & appending queries
Data source parameters
Importing Excel models

STAGE 2: Creating a Relational Data Model
In stage 2 we’ll review data modeling best practices, introduce topics like cardinality, normalization, filter flow and star schemas, and begin to build our AdventureWorks data model from the ground up:

Database normalization
Fact & dimension tables
Primary & foreign keys
Star & snowflake schemas
Active & inactive relationships
Relationship cardinality
Filter context & flow
Bi-directional filters
Model layouts
Data formats & categories
Hierarchies

STAGE 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX
In stage 3 we’ll introduce data analysis expressions (DAX). We’ll create calculated columns and measures, explore topics like row and filter context, and practice applying powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns:

DAX vs. M
Calculated columns & measures
Implicit, explicit & quick measures
Measure calculation steps
DAX syntax & operators
Math & stats functions
Conditional & logical functions
The SWITCH function
Text functions
Date & time functions
The RELATED function
CALCULATE, FILTER & ALL
Iterator (X) functions
Time intelligence patterns

STAGE 4: Visualizing Data with Reports
Stage 4 is about bringing our data to LIFE with reports and dashboards. We’ll review data viz best practices, build and format basic charts, and add interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, and more:

Data viz best practices
Dashboard design framework
Cards & KPIs
Line charts, trend lines & forecasts
On-object formatting
Table & matrix visuals
Conditional formatting
Top N filtering
Map visuals
Drill up, drill down & drill through
Report slicers & interactions
Bookmarks & page navigation
Numeric & field parameters
Custom tooltips
Importing custom visuals
Managing & viewing roles (RLS)
Mobile layouts
Publishing to Power BI Service

We have also used  powerful artificial Intelligence tools like decomposition trees, key influencers, smart narratives, natural language Q&A, and performance optimization techniques to keep our reports running smoothly at scale.

Information About The Project

An incredible Power BI Dashboard to visualize your finance KPI data. In this project, I learned how to take raw business data and turn it into useful insights by following these 4 steps:

1) Data Preparation - Connecting and transforming data using Power Query in Power BI
2) Data Modelling - Setting up a semantic model in Power BI with table relationships.
3) Calculations - Performing necessary number crunching using the DAX in Power Pivot
4) Dashboard Visuals & Interactions - Creating and customizing various visuals to generate our KPI dashboard. 

Key topics/ideas I learned are:
1) Power Query unpivot
2) Data Modelling with multiple fact tables
3) DAX calculations for YTD values
4) Using Emoji with DAX
5) Using the FILTER function in DAX
6) Working with the "NEW" card visual and reference labels
7) Using custom data labels with graphs
8) Sparklines in table visual
9) Working with Power BI report themes
10) Smart narrative feature of Power BI
11) Table formatting for executive reporting
12) + plus many other useful tips and tricks

Creating a Power BI report involves several key steps.

Data Connection- Import data from various sources (e.g., Excel, SQL, APIs).
               - Use Power Query Editor to clean, transform, and shape the data.

Data Modeling - Establish relationships between different tables.
              - Create calculated columns, measures, or hierarchies using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

Designing the Report - Drag fields onto visuals (charts, tables, slicers, etc.).
                     - Use interactive elements like filters and slicers for dynamic analysis.
                     - Format visuals to improve readability and aesthetics.

Adding Insights - Apply conditional formatting and tooltips to highlight key metrics.
                - Use measures to calculate KPIs like profit margin, growth rate, etc.

I am testing Interactivity - Test interactions between visuals (cross-filtering and cross-highlighting).
                      - Ensure slicers, filters, and drill-throughs behave as intended.

Publishing and Sharing - Publish the report to the Power BI Service or embed it in a portal.
                       - Share with stakeholders via links, apps, or dashboards.

Maintenance and Updates - Schedule automatic refreshes for live data.
                        - Monitor report usage and feedback to improve.

This summary gives an overview of the lifecycle of building and deploying a Power BI report. Each step ensures the report is accurate, engaging, and useful for decision-making.
