Information About The Project

An incredible Power BI Dashboard to visualize your finance KPI data. In this project, I learned how to take raw business data and turn it into useful insights by following these 4 steps:

1) Data Preparation - Connecting and transforming data using Power Query in Power BI
2) Data Modelling - Setting up a semantic model in Power BI with table relationships.
3) Calculations - Performing necessary number crunching using the DAX in Power Pivot
4) Dashboard Visuals & Interactions - Creating and customizing various visuals to generate our KPI dashboard. 

Key topics/ideas I learned are:
1) Power Query unpivot
2) Data Modelling with multiple fact tables
3) DAX calculations for YTD values
4) Using Emoji with DAX
5) Using the FILTER function in DAX
6) Working with the "NEW" card visual and reference labels
7) Using custom data labels with graphs
8) Sparklines in table visual
9) Working with Power BI report themes
10) Smart narrative feature of Power BI
11) Table formatting for executive reporting
12) + plus many other useful tips and tricks

Creating a Power BI report involves several key steps.

Data Connection- Import data from various sources (e.g., Excel, SQL, APIs).
               - Use Power Query Editor to clean, transform, and shape the data.

Data Modeling - Establish relationships between different tables.
              - Create calculated columns, measures, or hierarchies using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

Designing the Report - Drag fields onto visuals (charts, tables, slicers, etc.).
                     - Use interactive elements like filters and slicers for dynamic analysis.
                     - Format visuals to improve readability and aesthetics.

Adding Insights - Apply conditional formatting and tooltips to highlight key metrics.
                - Use measures to calculate KPIs like profit margin, growth rate, etc.

I am testing Interactivity - Test interactions between visuals (cross-filtering and cross-highlighting).
                      - Ensure slicers, filters, and drill-throughs behave as intended.

Publishing and Sharing - Publish the report to the Power BI Service or embed it in a portal.
                       - Share with stakeholders via links, apps, or dashboards.

Maintenance and Updates - Schedule automatic refreshes for live data.
                        - Monitor report usage and feedback to improve.

This summary gives an overview of the lifecycle of building and deploying a Power BI report. Each step ensures the report is accurate, engaging, and useful for decision-making.
